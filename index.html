<div class=col-sm-1"><h5>Where Love Lives</h5></div>
   <div class="col-sm-7">
Some love lives in the ancient Greek temple. The lovers as columns, standing strong and together but with space between them to support the structure, while friends and family create the colonnades. Each side has privacy touched by love emanating from the center hall, where time together is worshipped. This love is resolute, nourishing, a deep well that does not run dry but tastes of the bedrock surrounding it.
<br><br>
The love I learned of as a child lives in the American Colonial. Two columns out front just the same, but they stand anemic, tall, physically close but bearing no load. The spacious square rooms are cold and brittle. This loves worries and dotes. It can break easily.
<br><br>
Some love lives in split-levels, that standard approximation of the post-war suburban ideal, complete with front yard, backyard, driveway and garage. I do not know of the love within these homes but we were told that each home’s was the same and learned generationally that it was not. The building work was done quickly, suitable material on suitable land with not much more to it. Many loves were forced into these sliced and isolated spaces, with levels to hide from each other when love could not make its presence known. The papered sheetrock, the rug-covered steps, and the formica countertops all muffled the voices of love struggling to reach from bedroom to den. This love is disjointed, awkward, hidden, but exists none the same.   
<br><br>
Some love lives in ostentatious mansions, celebrating, hosting, performing, and groaning under the weight of its own maintenance. 
<br><br>
Other love lives in separate apartments, in dance halls, on subway platforms and in open fields. This love exists outside us but we are lucky enough to tap into it whenever we connect with another person in a stolen moment.
<br><br>
Our love would live in an adobe ranch.</div>

I realize now that I have to start living again. Or at least I now know what living does and does not mean. I've been keeping busy, traveling constantly, filling up camera rolls and bookshelves. Learning that it is easier to move forward than to move on. Reflecting on colors and textures but not moments past. Once again I find myself asking inane questions. Did I really live in California? The witnesses to my loneliest time are gone, distant, unreachable. I still haven't learned to live with the loss. My horizon is lost. But the sun rises, anyway, so I suppose I should get on with finding it.

   <div class="col-sm-7"><br>
With difficulty.<br>
Inherent, automatic, and vital to my existence. And yet I hold it away, straining myself unconsciously. I trap it where it offers no sustenance. It is only natural that I was diagnosed with adult onset asthma when we first met again. What came naturally is no longer natural to me.<br><br>
At night, with its rhythm, in your arms I do not have to think. I am filled and open. I can rest if just for a short while. You can feel me rest and I think I can feel your heart break to know that this is only temporary respite.<br><br>
By day, with each trigger, I am holding my breath.<br>
the endless repetitions<br>
the whatevers, if you wants<br>
the doting and the kisses<br><br>
I want to let it wash over me but I am suffocating of my own accord. I scream for air, or maybe my legs buckle. I am down on the ground or hiding in a closet and you are waiting. I try to calm down (really, I do). I remember all I have to do is breathe. Another will come when I count to five, count to eight. One hand on my stomach and the other on my heart while I make sure that I will survive. Will I ever know why this takes such concentration?<br><br>
I hope one day to breathe normally and to love you normally. You deserve that normalcy. I hope to deserve it too. <br><br>Sometimes I think all my struggling is just that I don't believe I deserve any of it; the air, this life, your love.<br><br>

<div class=col-sm-1"><h5>Loving animals in the built environment</h5></div>
   <div class="col-sm-7"><br>
I opened my eyes, loved my mother, loved my father. We left the building and my eyes drifted upwards, loved the trees, loved the birds. 
<br><br>
As long as I can remember loving animals has been a part of who I am. Earliest memories of black squirrels, multi-colored ducks, white geese and pink worms come to me when I close my eyes and think of childhood. The first terrible pain in my life was the realization that not every human loved animals. How could this be? I could not comprehend there was a choice in the matter. 
<br><br>
<i>Man beats dog, cat gets run over by car, bulldozer demolishes raccoon family's den, teens knock bird's nest of out of tree.</i> Why weren't all the adults united in outrage, ready to fix our world so that such atrocities could not happen again? I cried, questioned, bargained, begged. Those I looked up to failed to explain the torment away. 
<br><br>
Then we grow up, calm down, accept the world for how it is and fall lock-step into our built environment that guides our daily decisions. That's the plan, sort of. Living in a suburban environment hundreds of miles away from factory-style slaughter houses. Shopping in large grocery stores instead of local delis and butchers. But I knew by age 9 I could not eat a fish. I had a pet fish! I could not eat mollusks. They clung to the pier just like I did in harsh tides! Soon after the pet fish my parents finally relented and allowed me to get two dogs from the local shelter. Finally there were animals in my space I could pour my love into. I studied these dogs, learning their universal dogness and their individual uniqueness. I talked to them and about them like they were my best friends. My devotion to these dogs was the embodiment of the love I wanted to give all animals but could not. For every dead squirrel in the road, Maxie got an extra walk. For every dog fight or puppy mill horror story in the news, Benno got more treats. It was all I could do in my pre-teen understanding of the world I lived in. 
<br><br>
As you might imagine, I was one of those kids that had <i>way</i> too many stuffed animals. My attachment to them took on new significance in teenage years, and I regularly cried when I saw stuffed animals left out in the rain or thrown into garbage heaps. They symbolized to me our lost connection to the natural world and the natural order of love for all creatures. We pour love into objects instead of into lives. We realize the futility of this and give up. Our elders thought us childish and so discarded our objects and ignored our need to love animals. To this day the sight of a lonely stuffed animal can break my heart.  
<br><br>
I continued to eat meat for a few more years after the pet fish epiphany. Largely because my parents fed me and there were enough arguments at the dinner table already, but also because the meat we ate felt so remote from the animals I cared for. Upon moving out to a major urban city at 17 years old, I picked up a book called Rethinking Architecture. Among the first pages, during my first week in a city, in my first forays into buying groceries in local markets and farmer's stands, stood an essay by Georges Bataille called <i>Slaughterhouse</i>. In three short paragraphs I finally learned what had been plaguing me my entire life: how people could not love animals. Our environment hides them from us, separates our meat product decisions from our moral humanity. Our built environment seems inevitable - how dare that deer be in the road, the road is for cars! Architecture took on new meaning for me as a potentially hostile decision maker in my life that I had no control over, other than to be aware of it. I immediately became vegetarian. I spent more time seeking out wild places and sanctuaries. I talked more to farmers and distributors to learn what they had to share about our food consumption system. I researched all the animal rights and environmental organizations I could find, though always knew my efforts would be individual and personal rather than political. I argued, questioned, bargained, begged.  
<br><br>
These days I carry my love for animals differently. I still feel great pain when I see them suffer in our world, but now I have learned ways to focus these feelings towards good. Having grown up female in our contemporary society, I used to apologize a lot as a force of habit or a linguistic stop gap. I reclaimed "I'm sorry" as a quiet prayer to give whenever I see a dead animal on the side of the road, letting the world know that animal's life had value. I still do not eat meat or dairy but the conversations I have around this topic feel generative rather than combative. I take joy in watching the animals who have braved through our built environment with us and befriend all the squirrels, rats, and raccoons that will have me. I send the money I can to the organizations that do the most good with animals, spend time with other humans who think critically about animals, and visit sanctuaries as much as possible. My retirement plan, of course, is to get a rambling home with rambling land where I can nurture animals and nature and let it all nurture me. Loving animals in the built environment takes practice. It is a conscious effort. For me, despite the personal pain that comes with loving living creatures, the rewards of empathy and connection are worth it.<br><br>

<div class=col-sm-1"><h5>Loving a stranger, in wool</h5></div>
   <div class="col-sm-7"><br>
Loving a stranger is an easy thing to do. Moments together are brief and open to enticing interpretation. The patchwork pieces we've knitted over a lifetime of defining our desires come together to envelop the stranger. They become soft and warm in our knit dressings, unexplored worlds hidden within the fabric. We construct and arrange and revel in the lightness of creation.<br><br>
Loving a stranger is much harder to do when you lay with one in the same wool night after night. This is not the awkward prostration of two people who have grown to learn they are each not who the other imagined. This is laying in bed, soaking in the comfort of human connection, but disquieted by the unknowability of the person knitted to you. Is not breathing the same smog, eating the same meals, sharing countless sounds+touches, words+objects, supposed to erase "stranger" from our love? Not this time, not with you. <!-- Opaque takes on new meaning having you in my life. --> <br><br>
Loving a stranger is a fleeting endeavor, one to allow and embrace but recognize for what it is. I have loved strangers by the day, by the hour, even by the minute. I know this is OK because distance and time are our greatest protectors. 
<br><br>I did not love you from a distance. I did not love you for a moment. I love you up close. Unendingly.<br><br>
Loving a stranger is no longer just a thing I have done but a <i>thing I do</i>. The patchwork wool moves in on me through time and space and I, unprotected, now have knitted yarn in my eyelids. It itches, obscuring my vision. It is the visceral feeling of the uncomfortable truth that I will not know you, but will continue to love you all the same. <br><br>

<div class=col-sm-1"><h5>The honest letter</h5></div>
   <div class="col-sm-7"><br>
i wrote you a letter i thought i might actually send. it was a whitewash compromise of what i would really want to say and what you might actually need to know. it was useless, a waste of language, time, ink. i wrote it out five times, in my half remembrance of childhood-learned script, until it looked passably coherent and deliberate. now it sits on my desk as another tiny memento of my existential failure to communicate. the real letter i won't send would go something more like this:<br>
<br>
--,<br>
<br>
<i>It is the distance you create within yourself and between us that allows me to fill in the spaces so hopefully, so hopelessly. Your honesty (you want to be alone, sex is a sufficient approximation for intimacy) is noble but has the unintended consequence of creating a perception of closeness, even when the truths shared elide any such possibility. Space. It's everywhere, between us, in our conversations, in your plans. If you took some time out of trying to build your warm and enveloping but endless universe through sound, you might see that what i want to do is build a warm enveloping but endless universe in real space to share with someone who could exist there with me. 
<br><br>Part of this is on me: my loneliness manifests as a need to pour love into another's life. But this is also on you: knocking on my broken door with rusting cracked hinges, stepping in with your protective resin coating and silently, warmly accepting the mess. The lines and boundaries you create inside my unstructured mind have become an obstacle course where the end line is one field over from the field with your small house (finished basement, writing window). The field I land in is my small house (large porch, many pets) but the space between them is measured in acres or state lines or just the scale of your honesty.<br><br>
I am happy for you in your solitude, when I take it all at face value. A difficult but important task I must remind myself to undertake. You'd think me crazy if you found this, but, if you let me, I could love you. <br><br><p style="text-align:right;">I can love someone else too, so please don't worry. I don't much think you will.</i><br><br>

<div class=col-sm-1"><h5>A love letter in the form of eulogy</h5></div>

<div class="col-sm-7"><br><i>Written and read out loud as the only child of a man who thought he was all alone, in front of the people who cared about him.</i><br><br>
Thank you everyone for coming today to remember and celebrate my dad's life. I know he was many things to many people. I want to share with you today who James Mescal was to me.<br><br>My father was and will always be the most important person in my life. From a very young age I saw a light and energy shine through him that just didn't exist in others. When the world seemed scary and confusing, he could shine this light on it and show me how wonderful it all actually was.<br>
<br>When I was about 9 years old I suddenly realized my dad could die. I don't know if it was a movie, or something on the news, or the fatal car accident that had recently happened outside our house. But every day for months after, i would sit in our bay window, waving him off to work and crying hysterically as soon as his car turned the corner. Each night he would hug me and laugh at me and say he would always, always come home.<br>
<br>As I stand here today, thinking of the last time I got the gift of his hug and laugh, I hope he knew how much they meant to me.<br>
<br>I cannot possibly recount all the memories that make up who my dad was to me. But if you will allow me, I will share some snapshots from my mind. I hope if you knew him that you can envision these as clearly as I do.<br><br>
<ul>
<li>him leaning back in his father's old blue corduroy recliner, eyes half closed, listening to Lucinda Williams or Beth Orton and mumbling about their beauty inside and out</li>
<li>him driving, singing at the top of his lungs, windows down</li>
<li>him bracing for me to jump into his lap to watch TGIF when I definitely weighed too much to be doing that anymore</li>
<li>him mid-jump, huge smile as he realized it was gonna be "nothing but net"</li>
<li>him stnading behind my mom when she was talking too much, keeping one eye straight and rolling the other to make me laugh</li>
<li>him putting on his best Irish accent as he slapped his friends on the back to say hello</li>
<li>him holding court at Aunt Alice's on Christmas Eve, telling stories too loudly, laughing and dancing until the house shook</li>
<li>him singing his little made up songs to me every night. I will hear them in my head for the rest of my life.</li>
</ul> 
<br>
My dad truly loved music and shared it with me always. As I grew older I was able to, occasionally, share music I found on my own with him in kind. One artist I turned him on to was Jenny Lewis. I would like to quote a line from her: "I was born secular, and inconsolable." My dad, a faithful man, knew I was not religious, but would often ask me to pray anyway. When he would hear my sigh or see my eyes roll, he would quip "That's OK, I have enough faith for the both of us!". He had a beautiful vision of a spiritual earth and heavens, and it brings me some small solace to know that he believed there was another place for him filled with peace and happiness.<br>
<br>For myself, though, I must believe that his time here was meaningful, short as it was. My dad had the courage to be a sensitive and open person in a world that does not reward sensitivity. He was kind to friends and strangers alike, sharing with them joys and sorrows, truly feeling and meaning every word he said. I always believed, as he battled his addictions and demons later in life, that these escapes were his way of trying to find happiness and energy again in a harsh world that continually beat him down. I also always believed that despite the pain he put himself, his friends, and his family through, the open, loving, and sensitive part of him could never truly be beaten down. It was stronger than any other fact of his life. his light and energy still shone through til the end.<br>
<br>I've taken on a lot of my dad's traits without intending to.<br>My belief that I am generally always right,<br>my willingness to change song lyrics to fit what I think sounds best,<br>my need to just break out into dancing,<br>my difficulties sharing pain or bad moments with others.<br>Then there's some things I didn't get. See: all my failed sporting attempts through the years.<br><br>But there are traits of his I want to actively emulate, to honor his memory.
<br><br>
I want to be kind to everyone, to put smiles on strangers' faces, to give a helping hand to those in need. I want to sing at the top of my lungs and truly not care if people think I am crazy. I want to share openly with people, reminding them we are all in this together. I want to see poetry in a starry night, in fallen leaves, in all the small things. I want to be more open to the beauties and sorrows of life. I know this may hurt the soul, but I believe that it hurts the soul more to close yourself to these experiences. My dad had a truly beautiful soul, a rarity in this world. I can only hope to fill some small bit of the void left by his loss. To all of you, I promise to carry him with me through my thoughts and actions for the rest of my days. Thank you.
